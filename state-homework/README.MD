# Homework for react training - part 1 - state

## What should be done:

- Using component provided in `src/components/catalogue.tsx` create a product catalogue
  - The catalogue should display a list of products
  - Each product should have a name, price, available amount and a button to add it to the cart
- The cart should be displayed above the catalogue
  - The cart should display a list of products added to the cart
  - Each product in the cart should have a name, price, amount and a button to remove it from the cart
  - The cart should display the total price of all products in the cart
  - The cart should have a button to confirm the order
  - When the order is confirmed, the cart should be emptied, and the available amount of each product in the catalogue should be reduced by the amount in the cart
- There should be a form to add new products to the catalogue
  - The form should have fields for name, price and available amount
  - The form should have a button to add the product to the catalogue
  - The form should have a button to reset the form

Styling is not in the scope of this task. It can look ugly, but it should work.

You can use any valid solution of handling the components state.
